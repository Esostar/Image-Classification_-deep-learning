It is made up of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.\n","\n","* __The convolutional layers are the key component of a CNN, where filters are applied to the input image to extract features such as edges, textures, and shapes. The output of the convolutional layers is then passed through pooling layers, which are used to down-sample the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions while retaining the most important information. The output of the pooling layers is then passed through one or more fully connected layers, which are used to make a prediction or classify the image.\n","\n","### Convolutional Neural Network Design :\n","\n","* __The construction of a convolutional neural network is a multi-layered feed-forward neural network, made by assembling many unseen layers on top of each other in a particular order.\n","* __It is the sequential design that give permission to CNN to learn hierarchical attributes.\n","* __In CNN, some of them followed by grouping layers and hidden layers are typically convolutional layers followed by activation layers.\n","* __The pre-processing needed in a ConvNet is kindred to that of the related pattern of neurons in the human brain and was motivated by the organization of the Visual Cortex.\n","\n","#### Now we demonstrate these layers:\n","\n","* __Convolutional Operation__the inputed image gets ready for entrance to a **CNN** model. In this layer, we have kernel layer for reducing the dimension of matrix which created from the input image . In addition to have related operation images,we have **Activation Function** that is usually **ReLU**\n","\n","* __**Pooling**:Pooling layers reduce the dimensions of data by combining the outputs of neuron clusters at one layer into a single neuron in the next layer. We have 3 types of **Pooling**: **Min** , **Max** and **Average**. This layer is for reducing the volume of input images, by removing non-important data,but we also have important points.\n","\n","* __**Flatten**: In this layer we have a **Flatten Array** of input images, Because we want to give a specail location to each data in a matrix.\n","\n","* __**Fully Connected (FC)**: Fully connected layers connect every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer. It is the same as a traditional multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP). The flattened matrix goes through a fully connected layer to classify the images.\n","#### Now, after the initial explanations, we go to model
